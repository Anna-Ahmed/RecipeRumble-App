To display the recipes in my app, I used RecyclerView. Using RecyclerView within my fragments enabled me to display a list of recipes whilst enabling scroll, Due to having a high number of recipes in a list, using RecyclerView can handled this efficiently. It does this by recycling and reusing item views as the user moves through the list making the performance of the app a lot faster. In addition to this, RecyclerView enables me to display dynamic content like recipe images within the lists.  RecyclerView also makes it easier to display saved and liked recipes combined with the view holder pattern. 

 

To navigate through my app, I decided to use a Bottom Navigation menu bar. I decided to use this option as my app consists of many different features. Therefore, I felt it was the best suited option as it makes the app easy to navigate and find what you need. Additionally, by using a Bottom Navigation menu bar, it makes the user experience a lot smoother. According to (Patel, S., Dar, U.F. and Cypert, B. (2024) one of the benefits of using a Bottom Navigation menu is that “It is easy to reach and use with one hand, particularly on large-screen devices. This improves your app's usability and accessibility by allowing users to switch between core sections without stretching or altering their grasp.”. This point strengths my choice of using a Bottom navigation menu over using Tabs or a hamburger menu in a Toolbar as, in today's technology world, many users now use one hand to navigate through their phones. By using a bottom menu bar, it makes it easier to use my app with one hand, which by using a toolbar or tabs can prove to be difficult causing negative user experience.
