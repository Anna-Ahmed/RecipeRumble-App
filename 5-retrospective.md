During the development of my app, my knowledge about android development increased. My knowledge about RecyclerView the MVVM pattern was enchanced. Overall, I believe I was able to complete most of the requirements I had set within the time frame. Although due to some difficulties with the recipe API I was using, I was unable to implement the search feature.Due to storage issues with the API I was unable to implement the notification system as I had run out of time. 

One thing that I would change is to work on the features I had less knowledge about first, as my lack of knowledge on notifications meant it took a long time to implement and with the errors I was facing I was unable to complete this feature within the time frame. 

If I had more time, I would add a working search feature with filters for recipes and add notification reminders. I would also like to add a feature where you can see the history of generated meal plans and have the option to save them to reuse the meal plans again. Furthermore, I would make small amendments to the UI of my app.
