I enjoy cooking however as a student it can be difficult in planning and knowing what to cook. My goal is to develop a recipe app for everyone however my main presentation target being  students. It might be difficult to consume nutritious foods and strive to eat three meals a day when a student moves out. Itâ€™s important for everyone to eat 3 nutritious meals a day. Therefore, I decided to develop an app that makes it easily for you to cook and eat nutritious meals especially when having busy schedules. Features of this application include, a section where users can search and view recipes, a section in which users can add their own recipes, a favourites page where users can save their favourite recipes to use again, a meal planner calendar in which users can meal plan. In addition to this, the application will also have a notification system to send reminders. There is also a page where users can save other recipes they may want to try to later.
