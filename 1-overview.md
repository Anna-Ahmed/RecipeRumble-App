I enjoy cooking however as a student it can be difficult in planning and knowing what to cook. My goal is to develop a recipe app to make cooking easier for students. It might be difficult to consume nutritious foods strive to eat three meals a day when a student moves out. Itâ€™s important for students to eat 3 nutritious meals a day. Students need to retain energy levels, supporting the cognitive function in cognition and memory all of which are crucial for university students. As well as supporting the immune system which is essential in young adults. Therefore, I decided to develop an app that makes it easily for students to cook and eat nutritious meals especially when students have busy schedules. Features of this application include, a section where users can search for recipes, a section in which users can add their own recipes, a favourites page where users can save their favourite recipes to use again, a meal planner calendar in which users can meal plan. In addition to this, the application will also have a notification system to send reminders. There is also a page where users can save other recipes they may want to try to later.
