I enjoy cooking however as a student it can be difficult in planning and knowing what to cook. My goal is to develop a recipe app to make cooking easier for students. It might be difficult to consume nutritious foods strive to eat three meals a day when a student moves out. It’s important for students to eat 3 nutritious meals a day. Students need to retain energy levels, supporting the cognitive function in cognition and memory all of which are crucial for university students. As well as supporting the immune system which is essential in young adults. Therefore, I decided to develop an app that makes it easily for students to cook and eat nutritious meals especially when students have busy schedules. Features of this application include, a section where users can search for recipes, a section in which users can add their own recipes, a favourites page where users can save their favourite recipes to use again, a meal planner calendar in which users can meal plan. In addition to this, the application will also have a notification system to send reminders. There is also a page where users can save other recipes they may want to try to later.

A nice idea that should be achievable in the time available. You have a motivation and a target audience, so you're well on the way. My suggestions are:

1. How does the app specifically serve students? Doesn't everyone need nutritious food that fits with busy schedules? I wonder if you can refine this to make it clear whether there are going to be features specficially targeted at students, or whether it's just the presentation aspects that will be targetted at students? 

2. I can see from your description that there is going to be a variety of Android API use in the app. Good stuff. I think the main thing to give some deep consideration to here is your data model. It's going to be fairly complex to model this in terms of having recipes and individual ingredients, and these things having to manifest in different places in the app (e.g., in the planner, but also through, say, a search function). You don't have to discuss it directly in this piece, but make sure you are giving sufficient thought to the modelling and implementation (DataStore Proto? Room? Firebase? Something else?) You will be able to save yourself a few headaches if you can think this through ahead of building. (Especially because if you use MVVM patterns you will not be able to fudge it!)

3. The motivation is generally fine, but I think perhaps you might have been able to save some more words from your introduction (e.g., talking about immune support) and redirected these to focus on features of the app. For example, what kind of reminders are the notifications conveying? To buy ingredients? To cook? Again, this will have implications for your data model.

4. You're two words over limit. We're going to be quite strict on enforcing the word limits, so have a look to see where you can save a few words here. Might seem pedantic, but part of the challenge of the portfolio is keeping to the tight word limits and we need to keep things fair.

Hope this is useful. Please do say if you have any queries – would be happy to clarify!
