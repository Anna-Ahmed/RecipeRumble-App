I enjoy cooking however as student it can be difficult in knowing what to cook. My goal is to develop a recipe app to make cooking easier especially for students .It might be difficult to consume  nutritious foods when a student moves out and it is challenging for students to strive to eat three meals a day. Its important for studnets to eat 3 nutriuius meals a days .Students need to retains energy levels, supporting the cognitive function in cognition and memory all of which are crucial for university students. As well as supporting the immune system which is esstional in young adults. Therefore I decided to develop an app that makes it easiy for students to cook and eat nutritious meals espieclaiy when studennts have busy scheudles. Features of this application include, a section where users can search for recipes , a section in which users can add their own recipes, a favourties page where users can save their faviourite recipes to use again, a meal planner calender in which users can meal plan. In addtion to this , the application will also have a notifcation system to send reminders. There is also a page where users can save other recipes they may want try to later.
