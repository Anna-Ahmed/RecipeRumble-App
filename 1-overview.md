My goal is to develop a recipe app mostly for students.  It might be difficult to consume wholesome, nutrient-dense cuisine when a student moves out and it is challenging for students to strive to eat three meals a day.  It important for studnets to eat 3 nutriuius meals a day  as  it Retains  energy levels, supporting the cognitive function in cognition and memoryâ€”all of which are crucial for university students in particular. As well as supporting the immune system which is esstional in young adults. Therefore I decided to devlop and app that makes it easiy for students to cook and eat nutrious meals espieclaiy when studen have busy  scheudles and assigment deadlines. Features of this application include, a section where students can search for recipes , a section in which students can add their own recipes, a favourties page where studnets can save their favioutre recipes ot use again, a meal planner calender in which students can meal plan. In addtion to this , the application will also have a notifcation system to remind students of what their next meal coming up is for their meal planning. There is also a  page where student can save other recipes they may want try to later.
